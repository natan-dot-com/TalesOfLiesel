# Tales Of Liesel

Tales of Liesel is an open source idle-based game made with pourposes of learning how does threads and semaphores actually work. This project was initially made for Operational Systems (SSC0140) class at ICMC-USP. As an extension, all of the front-end related stuff (such as the UI) were made using C++ Qt. Besides being a fairly simple game, it had worked pretty well for learning pourposes.

Current build only does support Windows. Linux support coming later on.

#### Did I get a good grade? We'll see!
